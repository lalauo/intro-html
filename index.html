          Helen Folasade Adu, is a British-Nigerian songwriter and lead vocalist
          of eponymous band Sade. Sade’s first single, Your Love Is King, became
          a top 10 British hit in February 1984, and with that her life, and
          that of the band, changed forever. The unstressed, understated
          elegance of the music in conjunction with her look – unspecifically
          exotic and effortlessly sophisticated – launched Sade as the female
          face of the style decade. Magazines queued to put her on the cover.
          “It wasn’t marketing,” she says, “it was just me. And I
          wasn’t trying to promote an image." </p>
